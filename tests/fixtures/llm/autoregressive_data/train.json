{"src": "Since the beginning, Sensory has been a pioneer in advancing AI technologies for consumer electronics. Not only did Sensory implement the first commercially successful speech recognition chip, but we also were first to bring biometrics to low cost chips, and speech recognition to Bluetooth devices. Perhaps what I am most proud of though, more than a decade ago Sensory introduced its TrulyHandsfree technology and showed the world that wakeup words could really work in real devices, getting around the false accept and false reject, and power consumption issues that had plagued the industry. No longer did speech recognition devices require button presses\u2026and it caught on quickly!\nLet me go on boasting because I think Sensory has a few more claims to fame\u2026 Do you think Apple developed the first \u201cHey Siri\u201d wake word? Did Google develop the first \u201cOK Google\u201d wake word? What about \u201cHey Cortana\u201d? I believe Sensory developed these initial wake words, some as demos and some shipped in real products (like the Motorola MotoX smartphone and certain glasses). Even third-party Alexa and Cortana products today are running Sensory technology to wake up the Alexa cloud service.\nSensory\u2019s roots are in neural nets and machine learning. I know everyone does that today, but it was quite out of favor when Sensory used machine learning to create a neural net speech recognition system in the 1990\u2019s and 2000\u2019s. Today everyone and their brother is doing deep learning (yeah that\u2019s tongue in cheek because my brother is doing it too! (http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~mozer/index.php). And a lot of these deep learning companies are huge multi-billion-dollar business or extremely well-funded startups.\nSo, can Sensory stay ahead now and continuing pioneering innovation in AI now that everyone is using machine learning and doing AI? Of course, the answer is yes!\nSensory is now doing computer vision with convolutional neural nets. We are coming out with deep learning noise models to improve speech recognition performance and accuracy, and are working on small TTS systems using deep learning approaches that help them sound lifelike. And of course, we have efforts in biometrics and natural language that also use deep learning.\nWe are starting to combine a lot of technologies together to show that embedded systems can be quite powerful. And because we have been around longer and thought through most of these implementations years before others, we have a nice portfolio of over 3 dozen patents covering these embedded AI implementations. Hand in hand with Sensory\u2019s improvements in AI software, companies like ARM, NVidia, Intel, Qualcomm and others are investing and improving upon neural net chips that can perform parallel processing for specialized AI functions, so the world will continue seeing better and better AI offerings on \u201cthe edge\u201d.\nWhat Makes the Latest Version of TrulySecure so Different?\nA key measure of any biometric system is the inherent accuracy of the matching algorithm. Earlier attempts at face recognition were based on traditional computer vision (CV) techniques. The first attempts involved measuring key distances on the face and comparing those across images, from which the idea of the number of \u201cfacial features\u201d associated with an algorithm was born. This method turned out to be very brittle however, especially as the pose angle or expression varied. The next class of algorithms involved parsing the face into a grid, and analyzing each section of the grid individually via standard CV techniques, such as frequency analysis, wavelet transforms, local binary patterns (LBP), etc. Up until recently, these constituted the state of the art in face recognition. Voice recognition has a similar history in the use of traditional signal processing techniques.\nSensory\u2019s TrulySecure uses a deep learning approach in our face and voice recognition algorithms. Deep learning (a subset of machine learning) is a modern variant of artificial neural networks, which Sensory has been using since the very beginning in 1994, and thus we have extensive experience in this area. In just the last few years, deep learning has become the primary technology for many CV applications, and especially face recognition. There have been recent announcements in the news by Google, Facebook, and others on face recognition systems they have developed that outperform humans. This is based on analyzing a data set such as Labeled Faces in the Wild, which has images captured over a very wide ranging set of conditions, especially larger angles and distances from the face. We\u2019ve trained our network for the authentication case, which has a more limited range of conditions, using our large data set collected via AppLock and other methods. This allows us to perform better than those algorithms would do for this application, while also keeping our size and processing power requirements under control (the Google and Facebook deep learning implementations are run on arrays of servers).\nOne consequence of the deep learning approach is that we don\u2019t use a number of points on the face per se. The salient features of a face are compressed down to a set of coefficients, but they do not directly correspond to physical locations or measurements of the face. Rather these \u201cfeatures\u201d are discovered by the algorithm during the training phase \u2013 the model is optimized to reduce face images to a set of coefficients that efficiently separate faces of a particular individual from faces of all others. This is a much more robust way of assessing the face than the traditional methods, and that is why we decided to utilize deep learning opposed to CV algorithms for face recognition.\nSensory has also developed a great deal of expertise in making these deep learning approaches work in limited memory or processing power environments (e.g., mobile devices). This combination creates a significant barrier for any competitor to try to switch to a deep learning paradigm. Optimizing neural networks for constrained environments has been part of Sensory\u2019s DNA since the very beginning.\nOne of the most critical elements to creating a successful deep learning based algorithm such as the ones used in TrulySecure is the availability of a large and realistic data set. Sensory has been amassing data from a wide array of real world conditions and devices for the past several years, which has made it possible to train and independently test the TrulySecure system to a high statistical significance, even at extremely low FARs.\nIt is important to understand how Sensory\u2019s TrulySecure fuses the face and voice biometrics when both are available. We implement two different combination strategies in our technology. In both cases, we compute a combined score that fuses face and voice information (when both are present). Convenience mode allows the use of either face or voice or the combined score to authenticate. TrulySecure mode requires both face and voice to match individually.\nMore specifically, Convenience mode checks for one of face, voice, or the combined score to pass the current security level setting. It assumes a willingness by the user to present both biometrics if necessary to achieve authentication, though in most cases, they will only need to present one. For example, when face alone does not succeed, the user would then try saying the passphrase. In this mode the system is extremely robust to environmental conditions, such as relying on voice instead of face when the lighting is very low. TrulySecure mode, on the other hand, requires that both face and voice meet a minimum match requirement, and that the combined score passes the current security level setting.\nTrulySecure utilizes adaptive enrollment to improve FRR with virtually no change in FAR. Sensory\u2019s Adaptive Enrollment technology can quickly enhance a user profile from the initial single enrollment and dramatically improve the detection rate, and is able to do this seamlessly during normal use. Adaptive enrollment can produce a rapid reduction in the false rejection rate. In testing, after just 2 adaptations, we have seen almost a 40% reduction in FRR. After 6 failed authentication attempts, we see more than 60% reduction. This improvement in FRR comes with virtually no change in FAR. Additionally, adaptive enrollment alleviates the false rejects associated with users wearing sunglasses, hats, or trying to authenticate in low-light, during rapid motion, challenging angles, with changing expressions and changing facial hair.\nComments Off on What Makes the Latest Version of TrulySecure so Different?\nComments Off on Will passports one day be secured with biometrics?\nRich Nass and Barbara Quinlan from Open Systems Media visited Sensory on their \u201cIoT Roadshow\u201d.\nI started our meeting off by talking about Sensory\u2019s three products \u2013 TrulyHandsfree Voice Control, TrulySecure Authentication, and TrulyNatural large vocabulary embedded speech recognition.\nAlthough TrulyHandsfree is best known for its \u201calways on\u201d capabilities, ideal for listening for key phrases (like OK Google, Hey Cortana, and Alexa), it can be used a ton of other ways. One of them is for hands-free photo taking, so no selfie stick is required. To demonstrate, I put my camera on the table and took pictures of Barbara and Rich. (Normally I might have joined the pictures, but their healthy hair, naturally good looks, and formal attire was too outclassing for my participation).\nThere\u2019s a lot of hype about IoT and Wearables and I\u2019m a big believer in both. That said, I think Amazon\u2019s Echo is the perfect example of a revolutionary product that showcases the use of speech recognition in the IoT space and am looking forward to some innovative uses of speech in Wearables!\nHere\u2019s the article they wrote on their visit to Sensory and an impromptu video showing TrulyNatural performing on-device navigation, as well as a demo of TrulySecure via our AppLock Face/Voice Recognition app.\nIf you\u2019re an IoT device that requires hands-free operation, check out Sensory, just like I did while I was OpenSystems Media\u2019s IoT Roadshow. Sensory\u2019s technology worked flawlessly running through the demo, as you can see in the video. We ran through two different products, one for input and one for security."}

In the original article it appears to be a version tidied up for print, rather than a facsimile of the original drawing. Until the National Library of Wales decides to digitise the Peniarth manuscript and put it on line, or one of us can make the trip to Aberystwyth, the exact drawing will have to remain a mystery. Bell shows the board without a central square marking, and the original source doesn't mention any special properties of the square.\nTen starting setups for tawlbwrdd 11x11 was tournament tested, and the Tawlbwrdd Lewis cross 11x11 was found to be the distinctly only well balanced setup with no throne, balance -1.06 ( http://aagenielsen.dk/tawlbwrdd_summary.php ).\nRobert ip Ifan is the original source of information about the Welsh tawlbwrdd, and through F.R.Lewis we learn that ip Ifan describes the board as 11x11 with the only distinguished square being a throne in the center.\nSo it appears that the Welsh Tawlbwrdd 11x11 indeed has a throne, the same as we know that has the Saami Tablut 9x9.\nGiven the choice, the Tablut Lewis cross does appear somewhat \"un-taflic\" with its four double lines uncovered by the attackers. Usually lines uncovered by the attackers are single lines.\n(P.S. At the same time we also learn from the ip Ifan diagram that there exist no such thing as \"attackers' base camps\" as used in the Foteviken tafl).\nLast edited by Hagbard on Fri Mar 03, 2017 10:41 pm, edited 1 time in total.\nTwo more test tournaments of the two Tawlbwrdd setups were done to find a best choice for the World Tafl Federation Championship Tournament 2016 round 1.\nBoth setups were found to work all right, the game balances being -1.13 and -1.17, and both setups gave many good games.\nThis attackers' setup fits well with the ap Ifan text \"... twenty-four men seek to capture him [the king]. These are placed, six in the centre of each side of the board and in the six central positions.\"\nGathering all attackers in edge center blocks and thus leaving eight open lines and maximum empty space in the corners, could make one believe that the defenders can slip through all this open space easily.\nThe test games showed, however, that it's very hard for the defenders (white) to escape. I had a number of games against high rated players, and my experience was that for the defenders the game is very tight and slightly random, meaning that you might be lucky enough to early catch the opponent in a position where his moves can be forced all the rest of the game until white victory, and if you do just one white move differently it all falls apart and white loses.\nWhite's toolbox lacks the Millar Gambit with this setup (attacking f3 ao.), and one player mentioned that he misses it.\nThis defenders' setup fits well with the ap Ifan text \"... a king in the centre and twelve men in the places next to him ...\".\nThis setup allows for the Millar Gambit, and going through the games one finds a lot of interesting and varied game play. This is a game which can take many directions.\nThe two setups could do with further testing, but for now it seems that the Bell setup would be the best choice for the Championship round 1.\n2016-07-03 11:00:22 Tuireann: I think Tawlbwrdd 1 [Bell] creates more interesting games [...] and I have made some pretty unbelievable victories from behind on Tawlbwrdd 2 [Lewis cross] as black.\n2016-07-05 18:51:14 Sigurd: Between Tawlbwrdd Bell & Lewis Cross it's close, but I'll go with Bell at this point. More games of each are needed though. I'm hoping they both hold up.\nMay 22nd, Jarl Herjan on Facebook, photo of a fine tawlbwrdd board 11x11 with throne and no corners, and diamond-Bell setup, just as we recommend it here.\nThis is my new Tawlbwrdd (Welsh Tafl) which I had designed. In addition I have come up with a set of rules for Tawlbwrdd that is in keeeping with its literal translation meaning \"Throw Board\" which suggests the possible use of dice in the game. What I have come up with following my research and playing various versions of Tawlbwrdd is a game that is fun and easy to play with an element of luck and a gamble that would have appealed to Vikings and the Welsh in the early medieval world.\n\"Throw Board\" is an old mistranslation of the word \"Tawlbwrdd\", Tawlbwrdd simply being the wellknown Scandinavian word Tavlbord = Game Board, in my opinion.\nBut in any case Herjan has invented an interesting tawlbwrdd variant. How do one play this game?"}

Morris Carr, LLC on Thursday, August 9, 2018.\nOther than custody of a minor child, asset division is probably the most contentious issue in any divorce. You and your ex likely don't agree on what is the best or most fair way to split up your possessions.

Many couples focus on the home, which often represents the most significant purchase from the marriage. Another asset that can cause a lot of conflict in a divorce is a pension.\nGeorgia has its own unique approach to divorce, just like every other state. When it comes to splitting up the assets and debts from your marriage, they use the equitable distribution approach. For those unfamiliar with this term, equitable distribution involves looking at the circumstances of each spouse and other factors from the marriage to decide what is fair.\nEquitable does not always mean a 50/50 split, but rather a property division ruling based on the current and likely future circumstances of all parties. Typically, any assets acquired during the marriage, as well as any debts, are subject to division by the court. This includes assets that are only in the name of one spouse, such as a pension.\nThe courts will look at deposits into the pension account that occurred during the marriage. This will include any matching amounts for employers, as this is also compensation earned during the marriage. Amounts accrued prior to the date of marriage may be exempt from division.\nIn the case of standard retirement accounts, the court can simply issue a special order that requires the division of the retirement account. When it comes to pensions, however, it is often a benefit managed by an employer after retirement. In other words, there isn't an account to split at this time.\nThe courts may need to be creative with how they handle a pension. In some cases, they may award other assets worth roughly the amount that the spouse who doesn't have a pension would receive. Other times, they may order spousal support equivalent to the appropriate percentage of the pension once it begins paying out.\nIf you have a pension account, you should expect to share it with your spouse in a divorce or give away other assets to offset its value. If your spouse has a significant pension, you should seek a fair share of that account. In general, both spouses can expect to receive an equitable amount of the pension, as well as all other assets in a Georgia divorce."}
