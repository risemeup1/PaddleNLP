This tour group was particularly interested in technical issues related to: soil/vegetation approaches for water quality treatment; the ultra- violet finishing treatment that allows for human contact with the treated water; and soil capping issues for a former brownfield site. GreenWorks typically leads 4-6 tours per year since Tanner Springs Park opened in 2005. Tour groups have included national and international professional and environmental organizations and academic institutions. Visitors are interested in a variety of issues, including design inspiration, public involvement and outreach, and technical challenges.\nCouch Park comment forms for the playground and plaza improvements are due Thursday December 10th.\nGreenWorks was been hired by Portland Parks & Recreation to design the new playground, address accessibility issues in the plaza and install a new Portland Loo at Couch Park as part of the Parks Replacement Bond. We presented the three options below for the playground at an Open House on December 3rd . Online comments are due Thursday December 10th and can be found here: http://www.portlandoregon.gov/parks/68915. One of the top priorities for the playground is for it to be inclusive, which mean that it should be designed for children of all ages and abilities. We have been working closely with Mara Kaplan from Let Kids Play http://www.letkidsplay.com/ who is a national expert and advocate for inclusive playground design. Mara was brought on to the design team to help us design a playground that provides exceptional play opportunities for all children.\nGreenWorks met with the city of Astoria to present the Downtown Astoria Pedestrian Wayfinding Concept Plan. Those in attendance were city officials, focus group members, and Astoria community members. The presentation focused on distinct sign typologies that direct and inform pedestrians getting around downtown Astoria. Following the presentation was an interactive group discussion about sign locations, aesthetic preferences interpretive sign opportunities."}
